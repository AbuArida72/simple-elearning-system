# simple-elearning-system

This is a terminal based simple school system (no user interface)

The system will need you to first login as an admin using :
username : admin
password : admin

then you'll be able to create instructors and students accounts by entering a username and a password.

After creating the instructor's account you will be able to login as an instructor and create a quiz for students.

Logining in as a student allows you to take the assigned quiz and then presents you with the your grade.
